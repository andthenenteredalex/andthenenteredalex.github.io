Hello world! This is my first real blog post. I'm not new to the writing world, but I am new to the computer world. 

The software and computer industry buzzed with innovation and reimagination, and companies and individuals everywhere were on a mission: that each new day would mean more technological advancements; that the role computers play in even the simplest of human tasks would be greater than the day before. As computers became more and more competent, through Machine Learning, A.I., and who knows what other sorcery, wizardry and magic, gradually, the world became more dependent on our little computer friends. But, little by little, bit by bit, the human race was feeling like they were increasingly further from understanding how the computers were functioning around them. They struggled to interact with them. They were feeling left behind. And then entered Alex. 

I'm on a mission to make the difficult things seem easy. I have a passion for simplifying processes and believe that even the most complicated tasks can be broken down enough in order to be easily understood. Whether it makes sense now or not just yet, all that your computer is doing is processing one task after the other in a sequence that makes sense to the computer. Understanding and simplifying how computers work is a challenge accepted. 

I am going to post software and app tutorials here, as well as some software documentation. I hope I am able to help humans in understanding and being able to interact with their computer friends.

Thanks for reading!
