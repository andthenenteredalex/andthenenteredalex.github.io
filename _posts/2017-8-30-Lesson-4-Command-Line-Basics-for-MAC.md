Hello! This is going to start getting more complicated, I'm going to explain ways to specify location and modify commands. The only way to learn this is really by running them so many times they stick under your fingers. I will include a reference table in this post defining everything we've done so far with command line and all functions. I might throw in a few more things to experiment with.

reveiw:
we used mkdir, ls, and cd. we just ran the commands without any modifcations. For example: `ls` `mkdir title`, or `cd ~` . 


last 
ls 



mkdir

ls, using  / to specifying location.

ls /
cd /
mkdir /



If you still have the directories we made last time, these commands will work.

cd fun/fun
cd ~/zad
fun/fun/fun/fun
cd ~/Documents
