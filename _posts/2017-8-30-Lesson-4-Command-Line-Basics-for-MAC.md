### The Basics of the Command Line on a Mac

## Lesson 4

Hello! 
This is where things are going to start getting more complicated. Now that you are used to running commands and can make, change and list the contents of directories, I'm going to explain how to give the computer more specific instructions which ultimatey allow us to cut out steps.

## Reveiw:

Last lesson we used `mkdir` to make a new dirctory located in our current directory, `ls` to list the contents of the current directory, and `cd` to change our directory. We did specify which directory to change to and what to title our new directory, but we didn't take it further]] farther]]? than that. `cd ~` changed to the home directory, and `cd..` took us back (to the left) one directory. 

We can modify a command to do something more complicated, such as changing to a completely different directory, or specifying somewhere else to make a directory, and so on. *This modification is called an argument*.

explain / and have them do.


ls, using  / to specifying location.

ls /
cd /users/alex/documents
cd /
mkdir /

cd-
cd..


If you still have the directories we made last time, these commands will work.

cd fun/fun
cd ~/zad
fun/fun/fun/fun
cd ~/Documents



I will include a reference table at the end of this post defining everything we've done so far with command line and all functions. I might throw in a few more things for you to experiment with.
