Hello, all. This is the first post in my simplistic "how to" series. 

### How to Read an Analogue Clock


This is for youngsters, or anyone else that doesn't know how to read an analog clock or watch.

The clock’s face is organized in a complete circle, with the numbers 1 through 12 spaced evenly around the outer edge of the circle. All hands move in the same direction. Imagine all hands pointing straight up. When all hands are standing straight up, their tips move only to the right. From there they swing down the right side of the axis, then they swing under to the left, then up the left side back to the center once they reach the top. * 

* Fun fact: This is where we get the term "clockwise." The term clockwise defines a direction of motion around an axis, which is used to refer to the turning of a screwdriver or knob to accomplish a specific action. Since clock hands move in only one direction, this term is universally accepted and understood.


### The Hands

There are three hands on most clocks, each hand means something different. 

1: **the second hand**. 

If you look at the face of a 3-handed clock for several seconds, you will see one hand move. This is the second hand. It is called the second hand because it indicates which second of the minute you are in. 

Each time the *second hand* passes 12 a new minute has begun. 

2: **The minute hand** is the long hand that doesn’t appear to be moving. It passes 12 every time a new hour has begun. It points directly to which minute you are in. 

3: The short hand is the **hour hand**. It points to which hour you are in. It passes 12 once every 12 hours.

### Reading the clock.

<picture of a clock>


Look at the picture of the clock. Identify the three hands. Notice the 12 numbers and how they increase in the clockwise direction. Note that 12 is on top and 6 is directly across the circle from 12. The 3 and 9 are halfway up the sides from 6. The spacing is relative, meaning each number is the same distance from the previous number, and since the 6 is exactly halfway aroudn the circle, when a minute or second hand reaches the 6, half of a minute or hour has been completed.

Think of the number 12 as the finish line. Every time a second or minute hand passes the finish line, something new has begun. 
When the second hand passes 12, (our imaginary finish line), a new minute has begun. Each time the minute hand 
passes the 12, a new hour has begun. The second hand is called the second hand because it moves once per second and indicates which second we are in. The minute hand is called the minute hand because it points to which minute we are currently in.

There are 60 seconds in one minute. And there are 60 minutes in one hour.

The small hand, called the hour hand, shows you which hour it is. Each time the hour hand aligns with a number, that indicates 
that a new hour is close to beginning, or has begun already. It moves so slowly it can be difficult to read. Check your minute hand to see how much time is left before the new hour begins.  The hour hand only passes the 12, or the finish line, once every twelve hours.


The second hand indicates which second out of a minute you are in, just like the minute hand indicates which minute out of an hour. 


fact: <Some clocks have 60 ticks that go all the way around the face, 5 ticks per number, which precisely indicate minutes and seconds with their respective hands.>

**The second hand** is relatively unimportant because when someone asks what time it is. Unless you are a very literal person, the answer is never “Two thirty and 46 seconds.”

Most people only care about the “Two thirty” part of the time. That is why many watches and clocks leave do not have a second 
hand. This is easier to read and gives the watch a sleek look.

**The minute hand:** If the minute hand is pointing to the 6, the halfway point around the full circle, half of the current hour 
has been completed.

If the minute hand is pointing to the 3, then 15 minutes have been completed. For the minute hand, each number represents 5 
minutes.

If the minute hand is pointing to the 11, then we can deduce that it is 5 minutes to the start of the new hour. Many watches 
and clocks include a tick-mark for each minute, though if present,  are very small and hard to read. 

**The hour hand** is the trickiest hand of all. It is tricky because, half of the time, it points to the incorrect hour! 
So which hour is correct? It can only be one of two hours, based on what we know about how a clock or watch works. 

For this reason, I call it the “almost hand.” This is an easy way to remember that the hand only lines up with a number at the 
start of each hour. For the first half of an hour, the hand is closer to the hour that it is. But for the second half hour, 
the hand is pointing to what time it almost is. That is how I remember how to read this hand correctly every time.

A quick glance at a watch or a clock immediately tells you that it can be one of two hours. Look for where the smallest hand is pointing on any clock or watch. If it is between two numbers, the time is one of those two numbers. Look to see where the minute hand is. If the minute hand has not passed the 12 yet, then the hour is the smaller number. We remember this since the hour hand is our “almost hand.” It is either pointing to the number of the time it is, or it is pointing to the number it almost is. It is only ever one of those two numbers.  

Thanks for reading! I hope this helps anyone looking to learn how to read a clock!
