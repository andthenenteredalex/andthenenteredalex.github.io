Hello, there! This is Alex, I'm a cyber security analyst and this is my blog. I'm going to be rambling about technical things and exploring cool things I encounter in my learning expedition.

# Outlook Web App
I'm going to examine another phishing attack here. In today's scenario, an Exchange 2007 server, that is presumably controlled by the attacker. This is a legitimate mail server, so, though outdated, if an unsuspecting user were to see this page and be prompted for login credentials, there isa good chance it would look like everyday business to them. And that is the goal.
