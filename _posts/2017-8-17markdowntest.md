 +## Hello, World!
 +
 +As my first blog post, I thought I would begin by giving an overview of the broad range of topics that will be discussed on this blog: 
 +
 +1. Economics, specifically the macroeconomic environment, game theory, and fiscal policy.
 +2. Financial markets, specifically the equity and bond markets.
 +3. Data Science, specifically the application of modern data science techniques in financial auditing.
 +4. Internal Audit, specifically audit risks, mitigation techniques, and the use of analytics to bring Internal Auditing into the 21st century. 
 +5. Discussions of the current business environment, competition and strategy.
 +6. Information technology, emerging technologies, and their use cases.
 +7. Book reviews and summaries across the topics outlined. 
 +
 +The function of this blog will twofold: for the reader to learn new ideas or a different perspective on the topics outlined above and for me to solidify acquired knowledge. As I still have two semesters left in grad school, posts may not be regular at first, but will hopefully increase in frequency (and quality).
 +
 +Until next time,
 +
 +Andrew.
